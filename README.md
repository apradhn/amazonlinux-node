# amazonlinux-node
A docker image of Amazon linux running node. I use this to compile to node packages that I want to include in Lambda functions. Inspired by Tim Wagner's blog post [Using Packages and Native nodejs Modules in AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/nodejs-packages-in-lambda/).

Image hosted on Dockerhub at [abhijitp/amazonlinux-node](https://hub.docker.com/r/abhijitp/amazonlinux-node/).
